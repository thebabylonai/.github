[BabylonAI](https://babylonai.dev) is a Y Combinator backed company that specializes in helping clients with their computer vision needs. One of the ways we do this is by maintaining the Babylog library, which streamlines the process of streaming image and video data from edge devices to the cloud. Our library is designed to empower machine learning teams to log images and predictions, ensuring their computer vision models are working as intended.

We understand that getting started with computer vision can be daunting, which is why we are excited to offer a special deal to new clients. For a limited time (until May 1st 2023), we are offering to host the first 1TB of data streamed with Babylog for free. This is a great opportunity for clients to test out our service and see the benefits firsthand.

Our team of experts from Havard and ETH Zurich is dedicated to helping our clients succeed, and we are excited to see the amazing things they will achieve with our help.
